# 1. Personal data

## a. 
[I could calculate the frequency of each music genre for each given mood association (positive, negative, and neutral) by counting, because I listen to folk music often when I study, so I think the count for times I have listened to folk music while I'm feeling "neutral" (like focused or tired) will be higher than while I'm feeling "negatively".]

## b. 
```{r cleaning}
personal_data <- read_csv("data/193DS_Personal_Data.csv") |> # reading in my personal data frame and cleaning it
  clean_names()
```

```{r visualizing}
genre_mood_freq <- personal_data |> # creating a new object called genre_mood_freq
  count(genre, mood_association)
# count occurrences of genre and mood association

ggplot(genre_mood_freq, 
       aes(x = mood_association, 
           y = n,
           fill = genre)) + # assigning variables
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + # telling R to use y-values I supply directly
  labs(
    title = "Frequency of Music Genres by Mood Association",
    x = "Mood Association",
    y = "Count",
    fill = "Genre" # rename axes, title, and legend
  ) + 
  theme_minimal() + # changing the theme
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2") + # choosing a new color palette for the bar chart
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) # angling the x-axis labels to be more readable
```

## c. 
[Figure 1. Comparison of the frequency that I listen to different music genres between negative, neutral, and positive mood associations, which were self-determined based on my emotions at the time of listening. Stacked bar chart shows individual counts of times listened to each genre during each mood association, as well as total count of times listened to music during each mood association. Folk music exhibited the highest overall listening frequency, and was also the most listened to genre during "negative" and "neutral" moods, whereas house music was the most listened to genre during "positive" moods. Data collected and recorded in personal music listening log (193DS_Personal_Data.xlsx).]

## d. 
```{r flextable}
ft <- genre_mood_freq |> # making a new object called "ft"
  select(genre, mood_association, n) # selecting only these columns

 flextable(ft) |> # creating a flextable from the new object "ft" created
  set_caption("Count of Music Genres by Mood") |> # setting a caption for the table
  set_header_labels(values = list( # relabeling column headers for readability
    genre = "Genre",
    mood_association = "Mood Association",
    n = "Frequency")) |> 
  theme_box() |> # bolding the lines of the table
   set_table_properties(align = "center",
                       layout = "autofit") # centering the table on the page/output and autofitting the layout of it
```

# 2. Affective visualization

## a. 
[Using the Dear Data project by Giorgi Lupi and Stefanie Posavec as inspiration, I think an affective data visualization for my personal data could look like creating a unique symbol for each recorded data point that encompasses each column and is organized by date and time. Since my data includes music genre I could make each data point be a music note and change certain aspects of the music note to represent the information pertaining to that day of listening, which includes genre, mood, mood association, if I was listening with people, method of listening, selection of music, and if it was a playlist or not. Each music note's position on the graph would be dictated by the date and time that the data was recorded, with moving downwards corresponding to an later date, and moving right corresponding to a later time. Additionally, I would include a legend that describes how to interpret my data visualization depending on the characteristics of the music notes.]

## d.

[My data visualization contains 31 data points from April 20, 2025 to May 27, 2025 which each include what time I started listening to music that day, what genre it was, what mood I was in at that time, if that mood was positive, negative, or neutral, whether I was listening alone or with people, how I was listening to it, and if I searched up the music or if Spotify started playing it automatically for me. I found the creators of the "Dear Data" project, Giorgi Lupi and Stefanie Posavec, to be particularly influential in my creation of this piece because they were able to manipulate data from their personal lives in a unique way that I had never seen before, utilizing specific symbols and colors to represent certain variables. I drew my data visualization with pencil and colored pens on white printer paper, but prior to constructing the final product, I created a sketch, then an outline, and then I used a ruler to create the axes before drawing each individual point with the corresponding colors and symbols, based on my personal data I collected.]

# 3. Statistical critique

## a.

[The statistical tests the authors are using to address their main research question include ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, and the Spearman correlation, but I am choosing to focus on the Spearman correlation for this critique, as it corresponds to the figure I previously included in Homework 2. The creation of the included correlation heatmap as seen below, is created as an attempt to answer the question, how are immune peptides, gut microbiota, nutritional intake, and total proteins in honey bee haemolymph interrelated? Specifically, it adresses which variables are significantly correlated either positively or negatively, as well as whether certain microbiota components or nutrients are associated with stronger immune responses or higher protein levels. The use of a Spearman's correlation for this study is valuable as it does not assume the data are normally distributed and will capture correlation between variables even if the relationship is not perfectly linear.]

## b.

[The figure shown above represents a correlation matrix demonstrated by a color range,
with red being a positive correlation and blue being a negative correlation between the variables listed in the caption and in my answer for part a. Although this figure is clear in its visual representation of the correlation between the variables, with an asterisk denoting significant results, as well as the axes being readable, there is no inclusion of the underlying data or summary statistics. The omittance of the individual data points prevents any visual observations of patterns to be made, which is generally helpful in exploring data that exhibits collinearity, to determine what the best way is to express the results, so the figure fell short in this sense.]

## c.

[While I think that the use of color is helpful for denoting which variables have the strongest correlation (closer to 1.0), it makes the figure appear as visually overwhelming and is misleading in the fact that many of the red boxes with high Spearman's correlations are not statistically significant. Additionally, the colors chosen (red and purple) do not contrast enough in my opinion, to portray the results as desired.]

## d.

[If the creators of this Spearman's correlation figure would like to utilize color, I would suggest selecting two colors that would achieve a more effective contrast, so that it is clear which variables exhibit the strongest correlations, while also being significant. Additionally, if possible, a simplified figure could be created by omitting model components, grouping variables, or eliminating correlated variables in order to create a more readable visualization that only displays the most relevant data. In this situation, I think the most viable solution would be to group certain variables and create a ratio between the pollen lipids and protein concentrations, since these were analyzed as response variables for the ANOVA test, so some insight may already be had for their relationship. I think it would also be worthwhile to edit the figure to include the individual underlying data points, which could replace the redundancy that the figure exhibits with its inclusion of repeated correlations in the mirror image of each box over the central red diagonal. By cutting the figure in half along this diagonal, and deleting half of the boxes, that space could be utilized instead to display scatterplots using ggpairs(), for example. On this same wavelength, it is also an option to replace the red boxes along the central diagonal with a summary statistic because it is not necessary to include the Spearman's correlation of 1 that you get when comparing each variable to itself, and an additional graph would provide additional useful information about each variable.]
