# 1. Personal Data

a. I could calculate the frequency of each music genre for each given mood association (positive, negative, and neutral) by counting, because I listen to folk music often when I study, so I think the count for times I have listened to folk music while I'm feeling "neutral" (like focused or tired) will be higher than while I'm feeling "negatively".

b. 
```{r cleaning}
personal_data <- read_csv("data/193DS_Personal_Data.csv") |> # starting with my personal data frame
  clean_names()
```
