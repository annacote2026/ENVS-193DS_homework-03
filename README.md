## General Information

This repo is for practicing creating and critiquing data visualizations.

This repo is mine (Github username: annacote2026).

## Data and file information

There are two folders, a 'code' folder and a 'data' folder. All code is in the 'code' folder, and all datasets are in the 'data' folder. 

Within the 'code' folder, there is an 'images' folder that contains the photos of my data visualizations. 

Also inside the code folder, is the quarto template I created, 'ENVS-193DS_homework03.qmd' and the rendered html document, 'ENVS-193DS_homework03.html'.

My personal data is a csv file called '193DS_Personal_Data.csv' that is embedded in the 'data' folder.

The Rproj that contains all code and data from this analysis can be found in the root directory, and is titled 'ENVS-193DS_homework-03.Rproj'.

This README also exists in the root directory as 'README.md'.
